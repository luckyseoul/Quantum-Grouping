# QuantumGrouping
Quantum Grouping: Novel decoherence-resistant quantum comms for 401M km (Earth-Mars). Encodes qubits in entangled ensembles (n=4-383) with QND stabilizers, achieving 1000x error cut (F=0.9999) and 90%+ success. Optimized for RF/laser photonics, scales via 5-hop relays (~5-min delay). TRL 4-5, Mars 2030s-ready. Explore QuTiP sims and calcs.
